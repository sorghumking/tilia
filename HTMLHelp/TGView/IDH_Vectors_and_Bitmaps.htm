<h1>Vectors and Bitmaps</h1>

<p>For the most part, TGView is a vector graphics program. Vector graphics 
 are especially suited to line drawings and for output to devices with 
 different page sizes. The diagram is constructed in arbitrary <a href="javascript:BSSCPopup('IDH_Virtual_Units.htm');"
	id=a1>virtual units</a><!--begin!kadov{{--><script type="text/javascript"
														language=JavaScript1.2><!--
kadovFilePopupInit('a1');
//--></script><!--}}end!kadov--> 
 and is projected to the fit the display or paper size of the printer. 
 This paradigm contrasts with many graphics programs in which a chart or 
 diagram is designed with a specific paper size in mind. Consequently, 
 a diagram may be designed and printed to different paper sizes without 
 having to explicitly re-scale the diagram; the paper size is determined 
 at the time of printing. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whereas vector graphics are extremely efficient and well suited for 
 line drawings, they are not particularly well suited for patterned or 
 screen area fills. TGView utilizes bitmap patterns for area fills, mainly 
 for filling in the curves of silhouette style graphs, wide histogram bars, 
 and lithology patterns. TGView offers 33 different bitmap patterns. These 
 are all based upon an 8×8 pixel square. Because these patterns are pixel 
 based, they are dependent upon the pixel size of the output device. Typically, 
 their appearance will be very good on a display or when printed at 150 
 dpi or less. However, on high-resolution printers (300 dpi or greater) 
 the screens may be too fine to be resolved. This disadvantage of high 
 resolution is especially true for ink-jet printers. However, because of 
 this problem, some high-end laser-jet printers will print bitmap patterns 
 at the equivalent size resolution of 150 dpi, although because of the 
 higher resolution of the printer these patterns are smoother than when 
 printed on a 150 dpi printer. In any case, bitmap area fills are device 
 dependent. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If TGView is used to print the final diagram, bitmap area fills may 
 produce the desired result. However, because of their device dependence, 
 bitmaps may not transfer to other graphics software. The bitmaps are stored 
 in Enhanced Windows Metafiles (*.emf), which TGView can write. Metafile 
 viewers such as Digital Formation's MetaView and Microsoft's Windows PIcture 
 and Fax Viewer will display the bitmaps correctly. However, high-end graphics 
 packages such as CorelDraw will not import them. PowerPoint will import 
 them as long as the graphic is not converted to a PowerPoint drawing object.</p>
