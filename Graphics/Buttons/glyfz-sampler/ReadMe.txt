Glyfz Sampler
=============

This sampler has been provided to give you a taste of the Glyfz sets. The images are covered by the Glyfz license which can be read at http://www.glyfz.com/license.htm. Basically the sampler isn't re-distributable without permission however you're free to use them in your applications as long as they're compile in to your executable.

The Glyfz Original Style folder contains the samples from the first series of Glyfz released. They've been designed to provide high quality, clean looking toolbar graphics and are provided in 16x16, 24x24 and 28x28 formats. The 28x28 format was introduced in order to provide the maximum clarity whilst only taking up slightly more space than the 24x24 format (32x32 being too large for the majority of projects). There are 6 sets contains a minimum of 100 glyphs, some substantially more, in cold, hot and disabled states.

The Glyfz Office 2003 folder contains a sample of the Office 2003 style Glyfz in both BMP and alpha-blended PNG formats and all sizes, 16x16, 24x24, 28x28. Sets 1 and 2 contain over 850 images.

On purchase of sets, a utility is freely availble allowing you to convert the images icon, transparent gif and transparent png formats. 

The Glyfz128 folder provides a sample from the larger 128x128 images designed for use in splash screens and application icons. The images are created in layers allowing easy customisation. For example in the calendar image it's a simple matter to hide the month and days by turning off those layers. The Shadows folder contains a flattened image with shadow applied. A selection of splash screen background will also be provided.
